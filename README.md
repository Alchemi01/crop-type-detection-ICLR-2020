# Crop Type Detection Challenge at CV4A Workshop, ICLR 2020


This challenge aimed to create a machine learning model to classify fields by crop type from images collected during the growing season by the Sentinel-2 satellite.The dataset contains a total of more than 4,000 field images contains 12 bands of observations from Sentinel-2 L2A product (observations in the ultra-blue, blue, green, red; visible and near-infrared (VNIR); and short wave infrared (SWIR) spectra), as well as a cloud probability layer. The bands are mapped to a common 10mx10m spatial resolution grid.

Founded in 2016, [Radiant Earth Foundation](www.radiant.earth) is a nonprofit organization focused on empowering organizations and individuals globally with open Machine Learning (ML) and Earth observations (EO) data, standards and tools to address the world’s most critical international development challenges. With broad experience as a neutral entity working with commercial, academic, governmental and non-governmental partners to expand EO data and information used in the global development sector, Radiant Earth Foundation recognizes the opportunity that exists today to advance new applications and products through use of ML.

To fill this need, Radiant Earth has established Radiant MLHub as an open ML commons for EO. Radiant MLHub is the first open digital data repository that allows anyone to discover and access high-quality EO training datasets. In addition to discovering others’ data, individuals and organizations can use Radiant MLHub to register or share their own training data, thereby maximizing its reach and utility. Furthermore, Radiant MLHub maps all of the training data that it hosts so stakeholders can easily pinpoint geographical areas from which more data is needed.
